# STA Project Guidelines #
## Task statement ##
  * All tasks must be driven by Issue engine.
  * All tasks can be stated by any of the team members (TM) and assigned to any of the TM. However, Issue Placeholders (IP) can be stated only by Project Leader (PL).
  * IP must be stated for each Project Milestone (PM) by PL.
  * Issue must have the determine fields:

---

Key result: _TASK\_KEY\_RESULT(S)_, e.g. ppt, internet channel        support, message handling, etc.

AD: _AGREED\_DATE\_OF\_TASK\_COMPLETION_

---

  * Issue must be created with Status NEW.
  * Issue with Status NEW must have its Status change to Status STARTED during not more than 3 days after its creation. This will mean that the Issue Owner (IO) started working on the problem.
  * After the IO completed his work according to the Issue he(she) must reassign this Issue to the Issue Creator (IC) with Status DONE (non coding task) or FIXED (coding task). If IC agrees with task completion IC change its Status to Verified. After that PL can close the Issue changing its Status to CLOSED.
  * If IO consider the Issue assigned on him as duplicate IO reassign it to its IC with Status DUPLICATE.
  * All questions about task tracking system address to PL.
## Coding Guidelines ##
  * All team members are free to use any coding styles but all the code produced by each team member must be reviewed by one or more team members.
